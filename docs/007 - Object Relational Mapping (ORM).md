# Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database, using an object-oriented paradigm.

## Pros and Cons os using an ORM library

### Pros

- Writing the data model in one place - easier to maintain. Less repetition.
- Lets of things done automatically - database handling, data types, relations, etc.
- No need to write SQL syntax (easy to learn, hard to master). Using your natural way of coding.
- Database abstraction - you can change the database type whenever you wish.
- Leverages OOP, therefore things like inheritance are easy to achieve.

### Cons

- You have to learn it, and ORM libraries are not always simple
- Performance is alright, but it's easy to neglect.
- Makes is easy to forget (or never learn) what's happening behind the scenes, which can lead to a variety of maintainability issues.
